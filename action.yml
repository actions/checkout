  ref:
    description: >
      The branch, tag or SHA to checkout. When checking out the repository that

  token:
    description: >
      Personal access token (PAT) used to fetch the repository. The PAT is configured

      We recommend using a service account with the least permissions necessary.
      Also when generating a new PAT, select the least scopes necessary.
